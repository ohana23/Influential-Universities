# Influential-Universities
Simple bar graph plotting the number of "influential universities" per country. Influence is based on each school's PageRank score, derived by the sum of page visits and page redirects across Wikipedia (i.e from pages of notable alumni or inventions that link to the school's Wiki page).

For a more in-depth explanation, visit this great article by the MIT Technology Review: https://www.technologyreview.com/s/544266/wikipedia-mining-algorithm-reveals-worlds-most-influential-universities/

For the full dataset of all 1011 universities analyzed, vist https://www.technologyreview.com/s/544266/wikipedia-mining-algorithm-reveals-worlds-most-influential-universities/
